                        Our COO has a Bachelor's in Law from LSE, which she followed up strongly with a Masters in Management from Harvard. From there, having directed both Human Resources and Compliance at Lifeasible in the last decade, she has grown to be a fiercely competent organiser. Her acquired familiarity with algae through her years with our partner Lifeasible, as well as close ties with many of the executives at Lifeasible makes her the bridge between the two companies, as well as already intimately well trained for the operational side of algal research and industrial scaling.

                        Our CSO has a BSc in Biochemistry and Genetics from the University of Sheffield which was followed by an MSc in Algal Biotechnology and Bioeconomy at the University of the Highlands and the Islands. From there, Joelle went on to complete a PhD at the University of Madrid, where she worked alongside Federica Bertocchini, managing to identify enzymes in the wax worm insect which are capable of oxidising and degrading polyethylene both at room temperature and in aqueous conditions. Our CSO's extensive background in algal bioengineering and groundbreaking enzyme discoveries have undoubtedly played an essential part in getting RecycAlgal to where it is today.                             </p>
